Open Terminal.

Paste the text below, replacing the email used in the example with your GitHub email address.

	commd: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "amir@bitspro.com"

	Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

		commd: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "amir@bitspro.com"

	> Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair.

	Enter the file to save the key /home/

	Enter passphrase: (just press enter)

 	Enter same passphrase again: (just press enter)


 ADDING YOUR SSH KET TO SSH-AGENT

 Start the ssh-agent in the background.

 	commd: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

 	> Agent pid 59566


 Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.

 	If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.

 	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

 Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
 	
 	If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.

 	command: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

 	# ^^^^this command will (most probably copy the key to clipboard)

	# Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
	
	# Go to Github profile settings > SSH and GPG keys

	# Paste the copied key and (add any title, doesnt matter)

	# click Add SSH key
